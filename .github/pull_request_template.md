## Before Opening a PR
- [ ] I tested this using the CLI (e.g., `poetry run vaccine-feed-ingest <state>/<site>`)
- [ ] I ran auto-formatting: `poetry run tox -e lint-fix`
- [ ] If this is a normalizer, I validated that the latitude/longitude in the output are not flipped. In the continental US the latitude ranges from ~`25` to ~`50`, and the longitude ranges from ~`-124` to ~`-65`
