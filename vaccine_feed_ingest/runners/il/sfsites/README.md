# IL sfsites

Scrapes the State of Illinois pages for [Vaccination
Locations](https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/s/vaccination-location) and
[Statewide Vaccination
Locations](https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/s/statewide-vaccination-locations).
The former is a superset of the latter, but it's useful to know which locations
are open to all Illinois residents. These pages are built with
Salesforce/Siteforce.
